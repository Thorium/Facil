# This document explains everything you can specify in facil.yaml. You can of course often
# get away with a much simpler config file. Click the link below to view the minimal
# config file that is added to your project if you build without an existing config file:
# https://github.com/cmeeren/Facil/blob/master/src/Facil.Generator/facil_minimal.yaml


# The optional 'configs' section allows you to specify where variables are resolved from.
# Each array item translates more or less exactly into a call to the corresponding
# Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigurationBuilder.Add* method, in the order you
# specify here (i.e., later config sources will override already added config sources if
# there are collisions). Any config type may be added multiple times. This section is only
# required if you are using variables (e.g. for the connection string). For more
# information, see:
# - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration
# - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.configurationbuilder
configs:

  # 'appSettings' allow you to use configuration values from appsettings.json.
  - appSettings: path/from/project/to/appsettings.json

  # 'userSecrets' allow you to use configuration values from user secrets.
  - userSecrets: 80d5e7ec-f577-4360-b60a-f10ea004da1d

  # 'envVars' allow you to use configuration values from environment variables. Supply the
  # prefix that environment variable names must start with. The prefix will be removed
  # from the environment variable names.
  - envVars: ''


# Rulesets allow you to specify what you should generate. Each ruleset may only use a
# single DB and generates a single file. You will often only need one ruleset.
rulesets:

  # 'connectionString' is the only required property of a ruleset. You may use a
  # variable here with the syntax $(VariableName).
  - connectionString: $(ConnectionStrings:Db)

    # The filename and namespace/module declaration of the generated file. The values
    # below are the defaults.
    filename: DbGen.fs
    namespaceOrModuleDeclaration: module DbGen

    # The base path for all scripts (including temp table definitions) in this ruleset,
    # relative to the project directory.
    scriptBasePath: ../some/path

    # 'prelude' contains anything you want to insert at the top of the generated file.
    # This can for example be preprocessor directives to disable compiler warnings.
    # (#nowarn "49" is always inserted by Facil and is just shown as an example.) You
    # don't have to think about the initial indentation; all lines will be deindented so
    # that the least indented line is not intended in the generated file.

    # Rules to specify which stored procedures are included in the generation and how they
    # are generated. Each rule requires either 'include' or 'for'. All other properties
    # are optional. The effective config of any stored procedure is taken from all
    # matching rules, with values from later rules overriding values from earlier rules.
    procedures:

      # 'include' contains a regex to be matched against the schema-qualified procedure
      # name (e.g. dbo.MyProcedure). All procedures that match the 'include' pattern for
      # any rule will be included in generation, unless they are also matched by a
      # corresponding 'except' pattern.
      #
      # The rule below specifies that all procedures should be included in generation,
      # except the procedure 'dbo.ProcToExclude', and that all the matched procedures
      # should use ValueOption instead of Option for nullable output columns (unless
      # overridden by later rules).
      #
      # Note that all regex patterns in the YAML file are case sensitive by default.
      # Prefix them with '(?i)' to make them case insensitive (e.g. '(?i)^dbo\.myProc$').

      # 'for' contains a regex that specifies which already included procedures (also from
      # 'include' in later rules) this rule applies to. It will not cause additional
      # procedures to be included.

      # The rule below applies to all procedures containing 'dbo.User_' except those
      # containing 'dbo.User_Id'.

        #    records if there are multiple matching table DTOs. Will not match
        #    voption-enabled table DTOs if voptionOut if false, and vice versa.
        #  - 'anonymous': Use anonymous records.
        #  - 'nominal': Generate and use a normal record type (a unique type is defined
        #    for each procedure).
        #  - A qualified table name, e.g. 'dbo.User': If the name matches an included
        #    table DTO (see later), use that. Otherwise, treat as a custom record type as
        #    described in the next point.
        #  - A (sufficiently qualified) user record type, e.g. 'MyModule.MyDto'. This must
        #    be a record whose record constructor is accessible by the generated code.
